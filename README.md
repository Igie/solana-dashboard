App that helps you to manage, create and close DAMMv2 positions, browse and create new pools with custom scheduler, claim fees and such.
Currently, Phantom and Solflare wallets are tested and should be fully supported. Warnings during transactions are false positive, as this is a new dApp.

Usage: go to https://www.solana-dashboard.me/ connect your wallet, and do whatever app allows.
To see 20 recently created pools, go to Pool Creator or Browser and click on refresh button. This also adds some lag on the UI due to heavy method use, though this cannot be replaced and is implemented that way by cp-amm-sdk.

Note: This currently uses free Helius RPC, so it might work bad if there are many users connected at the same time. Future plans to upgrade RPC, if userbase expands.

I am still new to this and await your suggestions.
